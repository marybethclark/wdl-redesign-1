Manufactured by Kontron Mobile Computing, the ReVolution has a lightweight magnesium chassis and enhanced temperature specifications, and is ideal for conditions too extreme for standard notebooks.<br>											<br>																	The ReVolution is tested to U.S Military and NEMA standards for resistance to shock, vibration, water, temperature and dust. It features wireless data communications, such as embedded 802.11b and Bluetooth technology for WAN connectivity. <br>											<br>																	The ReVolution has an extended temperature range of -15 C degrees to +50 degrees C. It is optimal for data acquisition in rugged environments or field service and maintenance. <br>											<br>																	The ReVolution, with a 1.20GHz Pentium III processor, is a fully Windows-capable computer that converts in seconds from a notebook to tablet with a quick flip of the rugged, 180-degree display hinge. The ReVolution comes standard with a 12.1&quot; resistive touchscreen display, or an optional digitized touchscreen display for pen tablet features, such as hand writing recognition. Both types of displays are 1024 x 768 XGA resolution, and are also available in a SVGA sunlight readable display for outdoor use.<br>											<br>																	The ReVolution received the Silver Award at the NASA Tech Briefs Reader's Choice Product of the Year Awards.
