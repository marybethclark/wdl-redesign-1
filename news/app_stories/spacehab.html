When the Space Shuttle Discovery was launched on June 2, products that we sold went up with it and were used to establish a continuous, reliable communication channel between earth and the shuttle. In the future those same products will be used to allow communications between earth and orbiting space stations.<br>								<br>													SPACEHAB&#146;s Universal Communications System (SHUCS) made its first flight aboard Discovery. It is comprised of an internal terminal, which operates much like a cellular phone, and an external piece that serves as an antenna to communicate with a satellite. By using the commercial Inmarsat satellite and ground station communication networks operation on the radio frequency spectrum, SHUCS enables earth-based users to interface with an orbiting payload or astronaut via the Internet and COMSAT Mobile Communications using the Inmarsat system. SHUCS can accommodate file transfers, up/downlink fax and voice communication.<br>								<br>													To make all this possible, SPACEHAB contracted with CrossLink, Inc. of Boulder, Colorado to identify and integrate the mission&#146;s hardware and software products for cost-efficient, high-speed data gathering, processing, and transmission. As systems integrators for SHUCS, CrossLink contacted EMJ looking for a single board computer in PC/104 form factor. The EMJ salesperson listened to CrossLink, thought about the application and recommended several other products. Ultimately, EMJ provided Crosslink with a JUMPtec PC/104 586 133MHz single board computer with Ethernet onboard, a parvus Versinet Ethernet board, a parvus PC/104 enclosure and fan card, and M-Systems IDE Flash.<br>								<br>Because EMJ Embedded  Systems was able to supply the needed information and products, CrossLink could spend their time on development instead of procurement. SPACEHAB went up with the communications system they needed. And EMJ had the opportunity to be involved in an exciting and cutting-edge project.<br>								<br>													When you are facing a tough embedded project, EMJ provides the products, knowledge and experience you need. Call on EMJ for high-quality single board computers, Flash solutions, solidstate card drives, 1.8&#148; PC Card hard drives, PC/104 enclosures and PC/104 solutions including MPEG boards and modems. EMJ is here to provide you with 'The Power Inside Tomorrow&#146;s Technology&#146;.<br>								<br>								<b>ABOUT EMJ Embedded  Systems</b><br>EMJ Embedded  Systems, a division of EMJ America Inc., distributes a full line of single board computers, CompactPCI solutions, Flash solutions, PC Card disk drives, PC Card readers, PC/104 add-on cards, PC/104 peripherals, displays, software and enclosures.
