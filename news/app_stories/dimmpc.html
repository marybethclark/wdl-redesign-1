Measuring 40x68 mm (1.57 x 2.68 inches), DIMM-PC/486 has the same capabilities as a standard 486 PC and represents a revolutionary step in personal computing. &quot;Computer hardware has continued to shrink while computer software has continued to grow,&quot; states Pratt, &quot;so that today we can fit the extensive software needed to drive a World Wide Web server into a computer the size of a box of matches.&quot;<br>								<br>																	Much faster than a Palm Pilot, yet small enough to be worn in a shirt pocket, Pratt&#146;s DIMM-PC web server sports a 66 MHz CPU, 16 MB of RAM, and 16 MB flash ROM, big enough to hold RedHat 5.2 Linux and run HTTP daemon. The server also boasts relatively low power usage levels, consuming 800 milliwatts from a 5V-power supply, rising to 2 watts at 100% CPU usage.<br>								<br>Pratt learned of DIMM-PC/486 late in 1998 while visiting the EMJ Embedded  Systems booth at the Embedded Systems Conference in Santa Clara, California. Immediately realizing the potential of the tiny CPU, he was the first person in the United States to place a DIMM-PC/486 order with EMJ. DIMM-PC/486 was introduced in November 1998.<br>								<br>																	Pratt explains, &quot;For me, the attractiveness of general purpose computers is the quantity and low cost of software available for them.&quot;<br>								<br>																	Measuring half the size of any other product on the market, the DIMM-PC is a full-blown PC that ships with 16MB DRAM, 16 MB of IDE compatible flash and supports two serial ports and a parallel port, as well as floppy and hard drive interfaces, a real time clock and watchdog timer, and an I2C-bus. It is ideal for running larger programs and, in addition to the Stanford Matchbox Web Server, is making its way into applications as diverse as security apparatuses, medical instruments, factory automation and global positioning systems.<br>								<br>The DIMM-PC is also available as a 386SX with up to 4MB DRAM and 8MB Flash. Ethernet and VGA modules in the same form factor extend the functionality of the DIMM-PC. To make initial testing and development easier, starter kits are available. For developers who do not need a Starter Kit, the DIMM-PC plugs into a standard 144 pin socket that is also available from EMJ Embedded  Systems.<br>								<br>																	To learn more about this World&#146;s Smallest Web Server and its designer, visit <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/february10/webserver210.html">http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/february10/webserver210.html</a>, or see Vaughn Pratt's webpage <a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/pratt.html">http://boole.stanford.edu/pratt.html</a>.<br>								<br>								<a name="kontron"></a><b>ABOUT KONTRON TECHNOLOGY<br>								</b>Kontron is a leading global embedded computer technology company.
