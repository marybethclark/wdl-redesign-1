Dedicated and embedded applications for PCs are beginning to be found everywhere! PCs are used as controllers within vending machines, laboratory instruments, communications devices, and medical equipment, to name a few examples.</p>								<p>By standardizing hardware and software around the broadly supported PC architecture, embedded system designers can substantially reduce development costs, risks, and time. This means faster time-to-market and hitting critical market windows with timely product introductions. Another important advantage of using the PC architecture is that its widely available hardware and software are significantly more economical than traditional bus architectures such as STD, VME, and Multibus. This means lower product costs.</p>								<p>For these reasons, companies that embed microcomputers as controllers within their products seek ways to reap the benefits of using the PC architecture. However, the standard PC bus form-factor (12.4&quot; x 4.8&quot;) and its associated card cages and backplanes are too bulky (and expensive) for most embedded control applications.</p>								<p>The only practical way to embed the PC architecture in space- and power-sensitive applications has been to design a PC - chip-by-chip - directly into the product. But this runs counter to the growing trend away from &quot;reinventing the wheel.&quot; Wherever possible, top management now encourages out-sourcing of components and technologies, to reduce development costs and accelerate product design cycles.</p>								<p>A need therefore arose for a more compact implementation of the PC bus, satisfying the reduced space and power constraints of embedded control applications. Yet these goals had to be realized without sacrificing full hardware and software compatibility with the popular PC bus standard. This would allow the PC's hardware, software, development tools, and system design knowledge to be fully leveraged.</p>								<p>PC/104 was developed in response to this need. It offers full architecture, hardware, and software compatibility with the PC bus, but in ultra-compact (3.6&quot; x 3.8&quot;) stackable modules. PC/104 is therefore ideally suited to the unique requirements of embedded control applications.<br>									<br>								</p>								<p><b>A Proposed Extension to IEEE-P996</b></p>								<p></p>								<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">									<tr>										<td class="bodytext">Although PC/104 modules have been manufactured since 1987, a formal specification was not published until 1992. Since then, interest in PC/104 has skyrocketed, with over a hundred different PC/104 modules introduced by more than three dozen manufacturers. Like the original PC bus itself, PC/104 is thus the expression of an existing de facto standard, rather than being the invention and design of a committee. In 1992, the IEEE began a project to standardize a reduced form-factor implementation of the IEEE P996 (draft) specification for the PC and PC/AT buses, for embedded applications. The PC/104 Specification has been adopted as the &quot;base document&quot; for this new IEEE draft standard, called the P996.1 Standard for Compact Embedded-PC Modules.</td>										<td></td>										<td><img src="/graphics/articles/pc104.fig1.gif" width="338" height="268" align="RIGHT" alt="Figure 1 - Basic Mechanical Dimentions" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5"></td>									</tr>								</table>								<p>The key differences between PC/104 and the regular PC bus (IEEE P996) are:</p>								<ul>									<li><b>Compact form-factor</b>.

In this approach, the modules are used like ultra-compact bus boards, but without needing backplanes or card cages. Stacked modules are spaced 0.6 inches apart. (The three-module stack shown in Figure 2 measures just 3.6 by 3.8 by 2 inches.)
